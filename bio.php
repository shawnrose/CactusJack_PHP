                <div class="project-summary">
                    <p>Chris Wood aka Cactus Jack is the leader, singer songwriter and guitar player of the group. He started out playing bass and guitar in punk bands in his high school years. In 2005 he started to experiment with acoustic guitar writing blues, folk, indie and country songs. In 2012 frustrated with not his sound, he briefly took a step backwards to play bass in a metal band. Then he went to an all country open mic and realized thats where his calling was. Quickley he switched in his bass for an acoustic electric and started his country thang. Something was still missing, he needed a band. Thats when the band name started in respect to his granpa Jack. Blending in a little punk, a lot of humor and a gallon of acohol infused country Cactus Jack is making his way in the Texas music scene.
